                <ul>
                    <li><b>1907-</b> Born in village Banga, Pakistan.</li>
                    <li><b>1923-</b> Joined the National College in Lahore.</li>
                    <li><b>1924-</b> Became a member of the Hindustan Republican Association.</li>
                    <li><b>1928-</b> British set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Lala
                        Lajpat Rai, a prominent leader of HRA, Rai died of a heart attack.
                        Enraged by his incident, Singh vowed to avenge Rai’s death and teamed up with other
                        revolutionaries, Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar and Chandrashekhar Azad to make a plan to kill
                        Scott.</li>
                    <li><b>1929-</b> Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its
                        public gallery. Their intention was not to kill anyone but to gain publicity. After the
                        explosion, the young men began shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long Live the
                        Revolution") and threw leaflets. Then they offered themselves for arrest.</li>
                    <li><b>1931-</b> Singh’s growing popularity bothered the British authorities greatly and the government
                        decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder trial, which was henceforth called the
                        Lahore Conspiracy Case.
                        Hanged in the Lahore jail. Bhagat Singh was just 23 years old. The bodies were then secretly
                        cremated outside Ganda Singh Wala village.</li>
